Would you like to know what The both complex and dynamic evolving nature of duck's migration is among one of the most important and challenging tasks in Artificial Intelligence. Typical AI models are designed to analyse time-evolving behaviour depending on observations. However, it is generally accepted that such methods is not valid for a wide range of applications. In this talk, Dr Python Duck aims to explain his novel approach to tackle this task. The goal here is to present the most promising solutions for streamlining the models for testing the addition of feathers on the Norwegian Duck Tolling Retriever.? The answer is on our meetup this Thursday at 7pm UTC with https://twitter.com/drpythonduck.
You can't miss it! We will wait for you there, #duckducklings!
