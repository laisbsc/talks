talk_name: Analysing the quacks on the equation - how AI can help map the ducks in the world
description: The both complex and dynamic evolving nature of duck's migration is among one of the most
  important and challenging tasks in Artificial Intelligence. Typical AI models are designed to analyse
  time-evolving behaviour depending on observations. However, it is generally accepted that such methods is not
  valid for a wide range of applications. In this talk, Dr Python Duck aims to explain his novel approach to tackle
  this task. The goal here is to present the most promising solutions for streamlining the models for testing the addition
  of feathers on the Norwegian Duck Tolling Retriever.
