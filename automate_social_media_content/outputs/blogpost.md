On Thursday, February 31st at 7 pm UTC | 8 pm CET, as part of the Why R? Webinar series, we have the honour to host
[Python Duckling](https://www.pythonduck.ai), from the PostDoc at the laboratory of Duckland, Aylesbury Current research lead at on the Analysis of feathers on the Norwegian Duck Tolling Retriever.. She
will talk about the Analysing the quacks on the equation - how AI can help map the ducks in the world.

  <br> Working as a Post Doctoral researcher in the Artificial Intelligence laboratory of Duckland, in Aylesbury. Python Duckling is a  well-known and respected Machine Learning specialist. With years in the field of aquadynamics, Dr Duckling is currently leading the cutting-edge research on the influence of feathers on the swim of Norwegian Duck Tolling Retriever.


The both complex and dynamic evolving nature of duck's migration is among one of the most important and challenging tasks in Artificial Intelligence. Typical AI models are designed to analyse time-evolving behaviour depending on observations. However, it is generally accepted that such methods is not valid for a wide range of applications. In this talk, Dr Python Duck aims to explain his novel approach to tackle this task. The goal here is to present the most promising solutions for streamlining the models for testing the addition of feathers on the Norwegian Duck Tolling Retriever.
