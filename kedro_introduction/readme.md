## Talk Proposal

 ### Summary
Have you ever had issues to share your Jupyter Notebooks? Ever had troubles with code that "works on my machine" **only**? Do you consider your
Research and Development smooth and straightforward? Is your code scalable? Tough questions, I know. But if you've mentally answered 'no' to any of
those you could use a tool to help with some of the pain-points of your workflow.
Kedro is an open-source Python library that helps data scientists write data pipelines following software engineering
best practices from the start. Known as the *Django of ML/DS projects*, Kedro is opinionated framework based on cookiecutter data science that allows
for modularity and scalability on data science projects. In this talk, I will explore the workflow of a Kedro project, introduce some of the most outstanding
features of the framework, such as the Data Catalog and show how to convert a Jupyter Notebook into a Kedro project, allowing for scalability and team collaboration.
 
### Talk structure
* Intro (5 min)
* The problem(s) (10 min)
* The solution (5 min)
* Demo - convert Notebook to Kedro project (15 min)
* Q&A (5 min)

#### Audience
 This talk focus on data engineers, machine learning engineers and data scientists who wish to learn how to write code beyond the Jupyter Notebook. 
 The audience is expected to know the basics of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. All levels are welcome.
 
 #### Key takeaways
 By the end of this talk the attendees are expected to understand the basics setup of a Kedro project, know how to convert a Jupyter Notebook into a
 Kedro project and to visualise the created data pipelines using `Kedro Viz`.
